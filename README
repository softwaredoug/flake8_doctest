Flake8
======

Flake8 is just a merge of the PyFlakes and the pep8 projects into one single
script.

It runs both tests by launching the single 'flake8' script, but ignores pep8
options and just uses its defaults.

It also adds a few features:

- lines that contains a "# NOQA" comment at the end will not issue a warning
- merging pep8 and pyflakes options
- a Mercurial hook
- more things to come..

Original projects:

- pep8: http://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8/
- PyFlakes: http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes


Mercurial hook
==============

To use the Mercurial hook on any *commit* or *qrefresh*, change your .hg/rc file
like this::

    [hooks]
    commit = python:flake8.hg_hook
    qrefresh = python:flake8.hg_hook

    [flake8]
    strict = 0


If *strict* option is set to **1**, any warning will block the commit. When
*strict* is set to **0**, warnings are just displayed in the standard output.
